# Weather Dataset 🌡⚡🌪🌈⛅🍃🌧☂

Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the conditions of the atmosphere for a given location and time. People have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia and formally since the 19th century. Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere at a given place and using meteorology to project how the atmosphere will change. In this exercise, you will use machine learning to predict the weather. You are given a dataset of weather history, and you're asked to give a model that predicts the weather, in this dataset you're also given no description about the dataset, this will make know how to deal with a dataset that you don't know anything about it.

**Dataset name** 

> weather.csv

**Features**

1.  `Formatted Date`.
2. `Summary`.
3. `Precip Type`.
4. `Temperature (C)`.
5. `Apparent Temperature (C)`.
6. `Humidity`: pupil-teacher ratio by the town
7. `Wind Speed (km/h)`.
8. `Wind Bearing (degrees)`.
9. `Visibility (km)`.
10. `Loud Cover`.
11. `Pressure (millibars)`.
12. `Daily Summary`.

**Target Variable**

4. `Temperature`.

# Objective

We want to predict the temperature variable given the other variables, so your task is to create a model that can do this task, this is a multiple linear regression model, you can use polynomial if you want to also.
