# King County Housing Dataset 🏠💰🏚📏💲

This dataset contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. It's a great dataset for evaluating simple regression models. 19 house features plus the price and the id columns, along with 21613 observations. This is a great dataset that will make you learn how to deal with a lot of variables.
