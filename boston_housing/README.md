# Boston Housing Dataset 🏠💰🏚📏💲

The Boston housing market is highly competitive, and you want to be the best real estate agent in the area. To compete with your peers, you decide to leverage a few basic machine learning concepts to assist you and a client with finding the best selling price for their home. Luckily, you\'ve come across the Boston Housing dataset which contains aggregated data on various features for houses in Greater Boston communities, including the median value of homes for each of those areas. Your task is to build an optimal model based on a statistical analysis with the tools available. This model will then be used to estimate the best selling price for your clients homes. 

This is a modified Boston housing dataset consists of 489 data points, with each data point having 3 features. This dataset is a modified version of the Boston Housing dataset found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing).

4. `MEDV`: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's (Price)

# Objective

We want to predict the price of the houses given the other variables, so your task is to create a model that can do this task, this is a multiple linear regression model.
