# Height Weight Dataset 🏋🏫📚🎓🧘‍

Human Height and Weight are mostly hereditable, but lifestyles, diet, health, and environmental factors also play a role in determining an individual's physical characteristics. The dataset contains 25,000 synthetic records of human heights and weights of 18 years old children. These data were simulated based on a 1993 by a Growth Survey of 25,000 children from birth to 18 years of age recruited from Maternal and Child Health Centres (MCHC) and schools and were used to develop Hong Kong's current growth charts for weight, height, weight-for-age, weight-for-height and body mass index (BMI).
